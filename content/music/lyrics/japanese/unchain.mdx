So･･･ and you know thin my soul
And blue all things must pass
I'm crying and sing my song
But they don't think my soul
I never fake･･･ oh thin mind flow
Early gone･･･

Night and day･･･ oh thin my soul
But they don't think my song
I never fake･･･ oh thin mind flow
Early gone･･･

Unchain･･･ Unchain･･･
Love me･･･ your soul Something･･････ your soul
Chain･･･

Everything it's allright baby･･･ cha･･･ chain

No･･･ and you know thin my soul
And cyber singer ring in frozen mind
I never say all thin my soul
Cyber singer sing in frozen mind
Unchain･･･ Unchain sorrow･･･ you

Unchain･･･ Unchain･･･
Love me your soul Something･･･ your soul
Chain･･･
Everything it's alright baby･･･ cha･･･ chain
