Now, I'm always by myself
With a heart of nothingness
I just want to sleep peacefully
Like a tree waiting for spring
I’m sure this pain will also
Disappear one day
When I wake up
You aren’t here

Nothing in the blue
Nothing in the blue
Nothing in the blue
Nothing in the blue
The vibrant season is now
Disappearing like the wind…
Disappearing…

Someone is playing the piano
Outside the window, if it echoes
I‘ll remember that smile
Where are you now?
