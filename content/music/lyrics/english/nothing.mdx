In a world of nothing
I keep walking on
Searching for the light
Through the darkness

Under an empty sky
I can hear your voice
Calling out to me
From far away

Nothing, nothing
There's nothing here but
Because you're with me
I can keep on living

On a road with no end
I walk alone
But your shadow
Follows behind me

Nothing, nothing
There's nothing here but
Because you're with me
I can keep on living
