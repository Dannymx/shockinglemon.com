As many of you know over the years we've been collecting the Shocking Lemon CDs, until now we were able to find most of them but one of those
hard to find was Pastel Room, but we finally found it in excellent condition.

But that's not all, we found it with an autographed photo of Shocking Lemon, by all members of the band! 👇
